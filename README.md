## üß© UE4SS + Mod V1.2 ‚Äî **BETA Pre-release**

üì¢ **Update Notes**

‚û°Ô∏è [Download the new version here](https://github.com/shn4rk/MorePlayerLobby-RvThereYet/releases/tag/Beta)

This update automatically creates the `Game.ini` file.  
Simply set your desired player count inside `config.ini` and start the game ‚Äî  
the mod will automatically generate a proper `Game.ini` with the correct value.

We recommend using the **latest stable release** once it‚Äôs available, as this version is still in testing.

If you decide to try it out, **we‚Äôd really appreciate your feedback!**
